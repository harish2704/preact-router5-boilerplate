# preact-router5-boilerplate
My minimal react boilerplate.

## Tech stack
  * [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) Instead of React
    - Preact is very small and more performant.
    - It provides a compatibility package called [preact-compat](https://github.com/developit/preact-compat) which can replace React without any code change
  * [Router5](https://github.com/router5/router5) Instead of React-router.
    - I personally like small and transparent modules which does one thing.
  * [Bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)
  * [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) with
    - hot-reload
    - production mode build
